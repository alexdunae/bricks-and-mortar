            <h3>In the Comox Valley</h3>

      <p>Bricks &amp; Mortar is a creative studio in the heart of the Comox Valley shared by a small group of designers, programmers and entrepreneurs who recognize the value of coming together to inspire one another in dialogue and collaboration. We chose its location a stone’s throw from Cliffe Avenue and 5th Street in downtown Courtenay by design. We understand the value of a vibrant downtown in small towns and cities and recognize that what we know of these places is currently changing dramatically. We’re here to participate in the conversations about the future of downtowns and to see how our respective work fits into that future.</p>

      <p>If you’d like to join the conversation or would like to know more about the work we do, please be in touch with us through any one of the websites listed below.</p>
